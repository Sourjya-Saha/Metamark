🔹 Layout
Use a grid-based two-column layout for each review card:
Left column: Product image preview.
Right column: OCR text, AI Vision insights, and compliance summary.
Each image should have its own card. Multiple cards should align in a responsive grid.
Cards should have smooth hover animations and neon-glow aesthetics.
🔹 Image Preview (Left Column)
Show the uploaded product image in a rounded-xl glowing bordered container.
Hover effect: slight zoom-in with neon purple/cyan glowing edge.
If OCR fails → show placeholder text: “⚠️ OCR could not extract text.”
🔹 OCR Review Panel (Right Column, Top)
Section title: “Extracted Text (OCR)”.
Display extracted text in a scrollable, dark panel with a glowing scrollbar.
Highlight compliance-critical fields:
✅ Manufacturer
✅ MRP
✅ Net Weight
Show green check icons when detected.
If missing, show ⚠️ warning badges in red/orange.
🔹 Vision AI Insights (Right Column, Middle)
Section title: “AI Vision Insights”.
Show labels with confidence scores as progress bars or glowing chips.
Example:
“Bottle – 92%”
“Text – 81%”
If confidence < 60%, display the label in a faded or warning style.
🔹 Final Compliance Review (Right Column, Bottom)
Section title: “Compliance Summary”.
Display a concise AI-generated summary for each image:
Example: “MRP missing. Manufacturer not detected. Product packaging is non-compliant.”
Style:
✅ If compliant → glowing green box with a check icon.
⚠️ If issues → glowing red/orange box with a warning icon.
🔹 Styling
Theme: Futuristic, dark mode, cyber/neon vibe (purple + cyan gradients).
Card design: Rounded-xl, blurred glassmorphism backgrounds, soft neon shadows.
Typography: Use Poppins font (uppercase for section titles, regular for body text).
Animations:
Smooth fade-in and slide animations (Framer Motion).
Hover effects: scale-up and glow intensification.
Expandable panels for long OCR text if needed.
🔹 Responsiveness
On desktop: 2-column layout (Image | Review).
On mobile: Stack vertically with image on top and review below.
🔹 Goal

Make compliance reviews clear, professional, and futuristic-looking, so users can instantly:

See the uploaded product photo.
Verify OCR-extracted text.
Understand AI Vision detections.
Read a final compliance verdict at a glance.

4. **Final Review Summary (Footer of Card)**

   * Short AI-generated comment per image:

     * e.g., “MRP missing, Manufacturer not detected. Product packaging is non-compliant.”
   * Style: glowing callout box with ⚠️ or ✅ icons.

5. **Layout**

   * **Grid layout**:

     * Left = Image preview
     * Right = OCR text + Vision labels + Final review
   * Use collapsible/expandable panels for cleaner UI if needed.

6. **Styling**

   * Dark theme, neon purple/cyan accents.
   * Rounded-xl cards with hover shadows.
   * Smooth expand/collapse animations (Framer Motion).
